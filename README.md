# React Landing Page Clone

This project implements a landing page using **React**, **CSS Modules**, and **SCSS**. The goal is to rebuild an existing landing page from [Landingfolio](https://landingfolio.com) with minimal code reference, focusing on structure, styling, and interactivity.

## Project Overview

- Recreate the landing page with React components.
- Use **CSS Modules** for styling.
- Implement **SCSS** for design scalability and consistency.

## TODO

- Choose a landing page and replicate its elements.
- Style the components.
- Create animations, videos, and interactive features.

## Stretch Goals

- Copy animations and interactivity from the original page.
- Open a pull request with a separate branch after the first commit.
